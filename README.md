# vihaan-Minesweeper-Game

## What:
A simple Minesweeper game using OOP. It opens up a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to play the game on.

## Where:
I made this in jupyter notebook.

## When:
This was made a few weeks ago.

## Why:
I wanted to make a game to grow my experience using OOP so that I can do more advanced projects in the future.

## How:
Using OOP and having different classes and functions for every aspect of the game, I was able to code these in-game functions. As well as using tkinter to create a GUI in which you can click each cell, blow up if you reveal a bomb, mark bombs, etc.
